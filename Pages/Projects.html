                    <h3>1995 Mazda MX-5 Miata – "The Roadster Revival"</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This beloved first-generation MX-5 arrived at the workshop as a neglected shell—rust spots, faded paint, and an interior that had seen better days. The owner purchased it at auction hoping to restore it to its former glory.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Restoration Story:</strong> We began by addressing structural rust on the sills and floor panels, carefully removing and replacing corroded sections. The original 1.6L engine was rebuilt with new gaskets, seals, and a full service. We re-sprayed the body in its original Midnight Blue, carefully matched to factory specifications. The interior was stripped and reupholstered with authentic period fabric, and we fitted new weatherstripping throughout. After 8 months of meticulous work, this iconic roadster was back on the road—and now it turns heads at every classic car meet.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> A stunning example of 1990s Japanese engineering; owner reports improved handling and reliability.</p>

                    <h3>1974 Mini Cooper S – "The British Icon"</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This iconic British Mini was discovered in a barn after 15 years of storage. With original cherry red paint faded to pink and the engine seized solid, it required a complete ground-up restoration.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Restoration Story:</strong> We stripped this beauty down to the bare shell. The chassis was inspected for rot and welded where necessary. The 1275cc engine was completely rebuilt—new pistons, rings, valves, and a bored-out cylinder head for added performance. The original Hydrolastic suspension was replaced with a modern setup for better handling. We re-sprayed the body in authentic British Racing Green with white roof stripes, fitted new rubber seals, and completely rebuilt the interior with period-correct Connolly leather. Custom alloy wheels rounded out the look. This little legend now commands attention at every concours event.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> A concours-ready Mini that captures the spirit of 1970s British motoring heritage.</p>

                    <h3>1999 Subaru Impreza WRX STi – "The Rally Legend"</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This second-generation WRX STi arrived with a blown turbo, significant collision damage, and a questionable service history. A former rally competitor looking to relive its glory days entrusted us with the resurrection.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Restoration Story:</strong> We began with a full structural assessment, repairing impact damage to the chassis and frame. The legendary 2.0L turbocharged flat-four engine received a complete overhaul—new turbocharger, intercooler, injectors, and a full rebuild of the internals. We installed a period-correct Prodrive exhaust system and remapped the ECU for optimal performance. The body was re-sprayed in aggressive rally blue with white striping. We refurbished the interior with Recaro rally seats, fitted a modern safety cage, and upgraded the braking system with larger Brembo rotors. After 10 months of intensive work, this fire-breathing machine was ready to tackle track days and rally events once again.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> A potent performance machine that honors its rally heritage while maintaining reliability and driveability.</p>
